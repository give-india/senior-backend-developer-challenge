### Objective
Write a REST-based API that enables the transfer of money from one bank account to another.

Account types are ‘Savings’, ‘Current’, and ‘BasicSavings’. A single user can have multiple such accounts. The following rules apply:
* Transfer between accounts belonging to the same user is not allowed.
* The balance in the ‘BasicSavings’ account type should never exceed Rs. 50,000
* Source account should have the required amount for the transaction to succeed

The API spec follows: (All amounts in the API are in paisa)

**Input (JSON)**
* fromAccountId
* toAccountId
* amount

**Output (JSON)**
success case:
* newSrcBalance: The balance in the source account after the transfer
* totalDestBalance: The total balance in all accounts of destination user combined
* transferedAt: timestamp

failure case:
* errorCode
* errorMessage

**Any language, framework, and database would do. Our preference would be Node.js since it is most commonly used across our tech stacks, but it is not mandatory**
